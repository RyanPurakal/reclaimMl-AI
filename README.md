## Overview

This project is a machine learning and web application pipeline for predicting athlete recovery risk. The system integrates:

- **Data ingestion and labeling**: Processes training data for model input.
- **ML pipeline**: Trains a logistic regression model using relevant features (e.g., volume load, sleep metrics, ACWR, and days since rest).
- **FastAPI endpoint**: Serves model predictions for new input data.
- **Streamlit dashboard**: Provides a live, interactive visualization of predicted recovery risk.

The goal is to give athletes and coaches actionable insights to optimize recovery and training schedules.
